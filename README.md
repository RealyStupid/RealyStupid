# Hello everyone! I'm RealyStupid
I'm RealyStupid, a hard-working solo Discord bot dev! I love getting technical with things, and programming is as natural to me as breathing.
I mostly program in Python.

## stuff I'm proud of:
- The Everything Bot
  - The Everything Bot is a program that lets you sync commands with its custom sync engine. It allows the developer to assign "modules" to their slash commands and enable/disable them using the given commands.
